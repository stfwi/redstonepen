## Redstone Logic Control - Client Adapter

The RCA (Redstone Client Adapter) allows, ***if enabled on the computer***,
to bridge the Redstone Logic Control via the client machine to local or
remote electronics, such as Arduino, STM32-Nucleo, RPi, ESP32, etc. Purpose
is to have a boiler plate for fun combining RL projects with Minecraft.
The interface from the game is kept optional, minimal, and safe/secure.

Detailed information about the RCA is located in the feature branch
`redstone-client-adapter` of this repository.
